# How to Run

As soon as user opens the website we would see "Top 10 movies" and the respective movie posters arranged in descending order. As the user brings the cursor on the movie poster it will flip and the rating, review and descripton will be shown. User can update ratings and reviews. User can alson delete the movie from the list or add a movies to the list.

While the user types in the entry box to add the movie and press enter, it will take the user to select page from where user can select the movie and add it.

For data, and lists we have requested from a [The Movie Database website](https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie). The movies added are stored in a database movies.db and delete option deletes the movies from the same database.
